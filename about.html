        <p class="text">
          Ford is a family company, one that spans the globe and has shared
          ideals. We value service to each other and the world as much as to our
          customers. Generations have made their memories with us and included
          us in their hopes and dreams. After 117 years, we’re used to adapting
          to and leading change. That’s why we’re evolving to focus on services,
          experiences and software as well as vehicles.

        <hi>OUR HISTORY</hi>
        <p>
          Henry Ford transformed not only the automobile but working life and
          the role of transportation. Having played our part in everything from
          the birth of the middle class to the recent global pandemic, we serve
          the world with integrity and competence. The Blue Oval is one of the
          most recognized corporate symbols in history, continually striving to
          earn the trust of all stakeholders.
